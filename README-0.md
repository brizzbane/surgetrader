# surgetrader
A python 3 library for general algorithmic trading and profit reporting.

## What working bots exist?

SurgeTrader has the following working bots:

* HOURLY SURGE: The first one was designed to detect coins with the strongest gain in price over 1 hour. It would then buy them and set profit targets. You can read about it in [README-periodic.md](README-periodic.md)  ... I'm no longer running it.
* TELEGRAM CLIENT: The newer bot, scans Telegram channels for buy signals and automatically executes them. Then it sets profit targets. You can read about it in [README-telegram.md](README-telegram.md) ... I'm currently running it.
* PRICE DIP: buys coins on a price dip

All bot versions provide daily and monthly profit reports.

**No stop loss has been implemented**.
