The Bittrex API returns the following Sell Close and Buy Open data for BTC-ARDR:


2018-01-17T23:16:49.69	2018-01-17T20:58:13.467	BTC-ARDR

The CSV has a sell close of 1/17/2018 11:16:49 PM
The CSV has a buy open of 1/17/2018 8:58:13 PM

So the CSV and the API are in accord.

Let's try again. Moving on to BTC-SWT

The CSV has a sell close of 1/18/2018 9:17:24 AM
The CSV has a buy open of 1/18/2018 8:58:12 AM


The User Interface sell close is 01/18/2018 04:17:24 AM
The User interface buy open is 01/18/2018 03:58:12 AM


The 5 hours diffence is because Bittrex knows I am in GMT-5, so it displays
things local to my timezone in the UI.
