SurgeTrader is a Python **3** cryptocurrency trading bot with various purchasing strategies
outlined in the main README. This README documents the Telegram channel purchasing strategy.

## What channels to use?

* MiningHamster has good signals and I use his KuCoin Signals. [Here are the results](http://mininghamster-kucoin-telegram-signals.blogspot.com/).

* [the Telegram channel of Trading Crypto Coach](https://t.me/Tradingcryptocoach) had very good performance. The only issues with trading him are (1) he doesnt always write the signal in the same way (2) his signals are for Bittrex coins and Binance is preferable for many. The results for him are posted [here](http://telegram-tradingcryptocoach.blogspot.com/). Like many non-objective signal providers, he glorifies his wins and speaks of them in terms of maximum profit but does not mention his losers. For instance his Bitcrystals call never went anywhere and we never hear a thing about it in his channel. But he is an excellent technical and fundamental analyst with a lot of good energy and has more than 120,000 people in his channel.

* [Jose's Quality Signals Channel](https://t.me/QualitySignalsChannel) provides free and premium content. He amalgamates trades from a number of sources. The format is 100% parseable everytime. The problem is the signals are mainly sideways and down. When Trading Crypto Coach provides signals, they jump and provide nice profits in a few days.

* [Crypto Signals Hub](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAE5kofiekf82MMAcFQ) provides free signals.

* [Coindetect](http://coindetect.org/top100) locates some of them.

* Googling and reading through Bitcointalk and Quora threads yielded some good ones.
* [SmartOptions](http://smartoptions.io) lists some good ones that are mainly paid. I found
Crypto-Addicts there and they boasted a 92% success rate but are only showing about 60%
success since the market crash. What is nice about Crypto Addicts is they give you a free
trial of their premium channel.
