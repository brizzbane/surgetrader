SurgeTraderBot: 60% automated return, steady success on red market days

Hi, I'm the author the FOSS automated cryptocurrency trading bot, /r/surgertraderbot

This month in Surgetrader, a number of things occurred.

First, Bittrex imposed a 28-day limit on orders you have on the books. This caused me to be out of the loop until I coded a fix for this. So even though I got a 60% return on my 1BTC I was trading, for about a week, I was writing the fix and not actually running the bot continuously.

Next, about [10 days ago, the markets ran red](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/7led87/majority_of_coins_down_hard_15/). But SurgeTrader reliably produced daily profit that day and **every** day of the entire month. Simply scroll through [the daily profit reports](https://surgetraderbot.blogspot.com/) and you will see no drop in profit return around the 20th of December. Just business as usual - identifying surges and closing profits.

Next, 16 days ago I had [my first $500 day in SurgeTrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/surgetraderbot/comments/7jzrqu/my_first_500_day_in_surgetrader/) ... Technically SurgeTrader has been doing the same thing it was doing 1.5 years ago when it was first developed and 1 BTC was worth $300 - it identifies surges and scalps them for small quick profit. But the thing is, the same small profits in BTC are now worth a whole hell of a lot of USD!
